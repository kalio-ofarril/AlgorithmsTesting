    What is the time complexity of the 'Tower of Hanoi' problem?
    Modify the program to track the number of moves (every time a disc is moved from one tower to another)
    and print it when the program completes execution.
    See how it changes when you change the number of discs to be moved. Does that give you an idea of time complexity?
