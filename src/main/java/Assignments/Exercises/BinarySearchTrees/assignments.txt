Write a method in your BinarySearchTree class which counts the number of leaf nodes present in this tree.

Implement a recursive algorithm to find the height of a binary search tree.

Given a sorted array in increasing order of elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with least height.
Before implementing, think about the strategy you will adopt.
